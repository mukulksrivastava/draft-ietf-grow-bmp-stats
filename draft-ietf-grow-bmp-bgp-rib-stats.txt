1.  Introduction

   Section 4.8 of [RFC7854] defines a number of different BGP Monitoring
   Protocol (BMP) statistics types to observe major events that occur on
   a monitored router.  Stats are either counters or gauges.
   Section 6.2 of [RFC8671] also defines several BMP statistics types
   for Adj-RIB-Out of a monitored router.

   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message.  The
   format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in
   [RFC7854].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The terminology in this document aligns with [RFC7854] and [RFC8671].

2.  Statistics Definition

   This section defines different statistics type for Adj-RIB-In and
   Adj-RIB-Out monitoring type.

2.1.  Adj-RIB-In Statistics Definition

   *  Type = 18: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In
      Pre-Policy [RFC7854].  Note that this gauge updates stats type 7
      defined in [RFC7854] and makes it an explicit for Adj-RIBs-In Pre-
      Policy .

   *  Type = 19: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-Address
      Family Identifier (AFI)/Subsequent Address Family Identifier
      (SAFI) Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy.  Note that this gauge is similar
      from stats type 9 defined in [RFC7854] and makes it a explicit for
      Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI,
      1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 20: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In
      Post-Policy [RFC7854].

   *  Type = 21: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI,
      1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 22: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by inbound policy.  Note that this gauge is different
      from stats type 0 defined in [RFC7854].  The stats type 0 in
      [RFC7854] is a 32-counter which is monotonically increasing number
      and doesn't represent the current number of routes rejected by an
      inbound policy due to ongoing configuration changes.  The value is
      structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.

   *  Type = 23: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      accepted by inbound policy.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Some
      implementations, or configurations in implementations, may discard
      routes that do not match policy and thus the accepted count and
      the Adj-RIB-In counts will be identical in such cases.

   *  Type = 24: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as primary route.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  A primary route is
      a recursive or non-recursive path whose next-hop resolution ends
      with an adjacency [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can have
      more than one primary path if multipath is configured
      [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best path is also
      considered as a primary path.

   *  Type = 25: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      selected as a backup route.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  A backup path is
      also installed in the Loc-RIB, but it is not used until some or
      all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths are used for
      fast convergence in the event of failures.

   *  Type = 26: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      suppressed by configured route damping policy.  The value is
      structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.  Suppressed refers to a path which has been declared
      suppressed by the BGP Route Flap Damping mechanism as described in
      Section 2.2 of [RFC2439].

   *  Type = 27: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked
      as stale by any configuration.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  Stale refers to a
      path which has been declared stale by the BGP Graceful Restart
      mechanism as described in Section 4.1 of [RFC4724], such as the
      routes filtered by a remote peer through application of policies
      during a graceful restart.

   *  Type = 28: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked
      as stale by Long-Lived Graceful Restart (LLGR).  The value is
      structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.  Stale refers to a path which has been declared stale by
      the BGP LLGR mechanism as described in Section 4.3 of [RFC9494].

   *  Type = 29: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the
      received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].

   *  Type = 30: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left
      until reaching the received route threshold as defined in
      Section 6.7 of [RFC4271].  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI,
      1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 31: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching a
      license-customized route threshold.  This value is affected by
      whether a customized license exists for the relevant address
      family, and when the customized license is installed.

      If the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific, this
      type value (31) SHOULD use enterprise-specific TLV encoding as
      described in Section 3.3 of [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

   *  Type = 32: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left
      until reaching a license-customized route threshold.  This value
      is affected by whether a customized license exists for the
      relevant address family, and when the customized license is
      installed.  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI,
      followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

      Also if the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific,
      this type value (32) SHOULD also use enterprise-specific TLV
      encoding as described in Section 3.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit].

   *  Type = 33: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes rejected by
      exceeding the length threshold of AS-PATH.

   *  Type = 34: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by exceeding the length threshold of AS-PATH.  The value
      is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.

   *  Type = 35: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy invalidated through the Route Origin
      Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)
      [RFC6811].  This is total number of routes invalidated due to
      origin Autonomous System (AS) number mismatch and prefix length
      mismatch.  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI,
      followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 36: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy validated by verifying route origin AS
      number through the ROA of RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 37: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy not found by verifying route origin AS
      number through the ROA of RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD1: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy invalidated due to origin AS mismatch
      by verifying route origin AS number through the ROA of RPKI
      [RFC6811].  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI,
      followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = TBD2: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/
      SAFI Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy invalidated due to prefix length
      mismatch by verifying route origin AS number through the ROA of
      RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte
      SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

2.2.  Adj-RIB-Out Statistics Definition

   *  Type = 38: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      rejected by outbound policy.  These routes are active routes which
      should otherwise would have been advertised in absence of outbound
      policy which rejected them.  The value is structured as: 2-byte
      AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.  This counter only
      considers routes distributed from Loc-RIB into the Adj-RIBs-Out
      and does not include cases like BGP add-paths [RFC7911].

   *  Type = 39: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes refused to be
      sent by exceeding the length threshold of AS-PATH.

   *  Type = 40: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      refused to be sent by exceeding the length threshold of AS-PATH.
      The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a
      64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 41: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-Out Post-Policy invalidated through the ROA of RPKI
      [RFC6811].  This is total number of routes invalidated due to
      origin AS number mismatch and prefix length mismatch.  The value
      is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit
      Gauge.

   *  Type = 42: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-Out Post-Policy validated by verifying route origin AS
      number through the ROA of RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

   *  Type = 43: (64-bit Gauge) Current Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI
      Adj-RIBs-Out Post-Policy not found by verifying route origin AS
      number through the ROA of RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured
      as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

      SAFI Adj-RIBs-Out Post-Policy invalidated due to origin AS
      mismatch by verifying route origin AS number through the ROA of
      RPKI [RFC6811].  The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte

   Note to the RFC Editor - remove this section before publication, as
   well as remove the reference to [RFC7942].

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was

   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
