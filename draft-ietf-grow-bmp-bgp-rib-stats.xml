	RFC 7854 defines different BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) statistics message types to observe events that occur on a monitored router.

<t>
	Section 4.8 of <xref target="RFC7854"/> defines a number of different BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) statistics types to observe major events that occur on a monitored router.
	Stats are either counters or gauges. Section 6.2 of <xref target="RFC8671"/> also defines several BMP statistics types for Adj-RIB-Out of a monitored router.
</t>
<t>
   This document defines new gauges for BMP statistics message. The format of the BMP statistics message remains same as defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/>.

		Type = 18: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy <xref target="RFC7854"/>. 
		
		Note that this gauge updates stats type 7 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/> and makes it an explicit for Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy . 
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 19: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-Address Family Identifier (AFI)/Subsequent Address Family Identifier (SAFI) Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy. 
		
		Note that this gauge is similar from stats type 9 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/> and makes it a explicit for Adj-RIBs-In Pre-Policy. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 20: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy <xref target="RFC7854"/>.

	<t>
		Type = 21: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI Adj-RIBs-In Post-Policy. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 22: (64-bit Gauge) Current number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI rejected by inbound policy. 
		
		Note that this gauge is different from stats type 0 defined in <xref target="RFC7854"/>. 
		The stats type 0 in <xref target="RFC7854"/> is a 32-counter which is monotonically increasing number and 
		doesn't represent the current number of routes rejected by an inbound policy due to ongoing configuration changes.
    
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 23: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI accepted by inbound policy.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    Some implementations, or configurations in implementations, may discard routes that do not match policy and 
    thus the accepted count and the Adj-RIB-In counts will be identical in such cases. 

	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 24: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI selected as primary route. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    
    A primary route is a recursive or non-recursive path whose next-hop resolution ends with an adjacency <xref target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic"/>. A
    prefix can have more than one primary path if multipath is configured.
    A best path is also considered as a primary path.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 25: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI selected as a backup route. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    
    A backup path is also installed in the Loc-RIB, but it is not used until some or all primary paths become unreachable. Backup paths are used for fast convergence in the event of failures.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 26: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI suppressed by configured route damping policy. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

    Suppressed refers to a path which has been declared suppressed by the BGP Route Flap Damping mechanism as described in Section 2.2 of <xref target="RFC2439"/>.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 27: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked as stale by any configuration.
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

    Stale refers to a path which has been declared stale by the BGP Graceful Restart mechanism as described in Section 4.1 of <xref target="RFC4724"/>, 
    such as the routes filtered by a remote peer through application of policies during a graceful restart.
	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 28: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI marked as stale by Long-Lived Graceful Restart (LLGR). 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.
    Stale refers to a path which has been declared stale by the BGP LLGR mechanism as described in Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC9494"/>.

		Type = 29: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching the received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.

	<t>
		Type = 30: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left until reaching the received route threshold as defined in Section 6.7 of <xref target="RFC4271"/>.

	</t>

	<t>
		Type = 31: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes left until reaching a license-customized route threshold. 
    This value is affected by whether a customized license exists for the relevant address family, and when the customized license is installed. 
	  <t>
		If the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific, 
    this type value (31) SHOULD use enterprise-specific TLV encoding as described in Section 3.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit"/>.

		Type = 32: (64-bit Gauge) Number of routes in per-AFI/SAFI left until reaching a license-customized route threshold. 
    This value is affected by whether a customized license exists for the relevant address family, and when the customized license is installed. 
    The value is structured as: 2-byte AFI, 1-byte SAFI, followed by a 64-bit Gauge.

	  <t>
    Also if the license-customized route threshold is vendor specific, 
    this type value (32) SHOULD also use enterprise-specific TLV encoding as described in Section 3.3 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit"/>.

    through the Route Origin Authorization (ROA) of Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) <xref target="RFC6811"/>. 
    This is total number of routes invalidated due to origin Autonomous System (AS) number mismatch and prefix length mismatch.

	This section records the status of known implementations of the protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of
  this Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in <xref target="RFC7942"/>. The description of implementations in this section is
  intended to assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs. Please note that the listing of any individual
  implementation here does not imply endorsement by the IETF. Furthermore, no effort has been spent to verify the information
  presented here that was supplied by IETF contributors. This is not intended as, and must not be construed to be, a catalog of available
  implementations or their features. Readers are advised to note that other implementations may exist.
</t>

<t>
	According to <xref target="RFC7942"/>, "this will allow reviewers and working groups to assign due consideration to documents that have the
  benefit of running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation and feedback that have made the implemented
  protocols more mature. It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as they see fit".
